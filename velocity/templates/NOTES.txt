- If there is a MongoDB connection error, make sure you have your MongoDB up and accessible from the Kube cluster. This chart does NOT install MongoDB.
- Make sure url.domain is set correctly in your values file. It is usually the ingress host name or the hostname of your Kube master node. If you have any reverse proxy in front of your Kube cluster, that becomes your domain. Do not use IP address.
